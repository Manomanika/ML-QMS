# ML-QMS
Leveraging machine learning (ML) technologies, airlines are transforming the landscape of quality service, offering unparalleled personalized experiences to passengers. By analyzing vast datasets, from customer feedback to real-time flight data, ML algorithms can predict passenger preferences, optimize flight schedules for efficiency, and even preempt maintenance issues, minimizing delays. This technological evolution enables airlines to tailor their services, such as in-flight entertainment and meal choices, based on passenger behavior and past choices, significantly enhancing customer satisfaction. Furthermore, ML-driven insights into operational data help improve on-time performance and baggage handling processes, directly impacting the overall quality of service. As these technologies continue to advance, the integration of ML in the airline industry promises not only to elevate the passenger experience but also to revolutionize the operational prowess of airlines, setting new benchmarks in airline service quality.
